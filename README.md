### Hello!

Hi, I'm Steven! I'm a Design Fabricator turned Data Scientist, and I have professionally worked on many different projects with a focus on the assembly of all kinds of sensors. From data gathering to data cleaning, from analysis to visualization, utilizing sensors via sound waves, Lidar, magnetic fields, and more, I have experience in the whole data pipeline.

In my spare time, I have been known to dabble in video game design and tinkering with RC cars. My current projects include teaching one such RC car how to drive itself.
